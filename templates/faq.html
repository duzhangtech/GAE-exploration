    <div>We created this free app to help students at UCSD transfer dining dollars.</div><br>

    <h2>Buy dining dollars</h2>
    <div>Click the offer that you want to buy and leave your email address. 
        When you verify your email address, an email regarding the transaction will automatically be sent to both you and the seller.</div><br>

    <h2>Sell dining dollars</h2>
    <div>Type in your offer details. 
        When you verify your email address, your offer will instantly appear on the market.</div><br>

    
    <h2 style = "font-size:22px;color:#383838;text-align:center; margin-bottom:40px;">F.A.Q</h2>        

    <h2>Who is operating this free platform?</h2>    
    <div>A nice guy. Just text me at 215-450-2878. </div><br>

    <h2>How do I edit/remove my offer?</h2>    
    <div>Type in your email <a class = "text_link" target="_blank" href = "/changeoffer">here</a>. You will get a link for directly editing/removing your offer.</div><br>

    <h2>How come I didn't get my verification email?</h2>    
    <div>If you use a different primary email, it takes a few minutes for ucsd emails to forward. Try checking your ucsd account directly.</div><br>

    <h2>What if I want to split up my dining dollars and sell them?</h2>    
    <div>Post twice. You don't have to verify your email again.</div><br>
    
    <h2>How much should I sell?</h2>
    <div>Make sure after you sell your dining dollar account still has the minimal balance.</div><br>

    <h2>Where can I find more details on the dining dollars transfer process?</h2>
    <div><a class = "text_link" target="_blank" href = "https://hdh.ucsd.edu/sso/DDContribution">Here.</a></div><br>

    <h2>The school my friends go to has a similar dining dollar system, could they trade their dining dollar here?</h2>
    <div>No. UCSD DD Exchange is exclusively for students at UCSD. If you or your friend would like to set up a similar system at a different school, please contact us at icmpexch@gmail.com. Thx!</div><br>
